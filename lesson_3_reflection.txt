1. When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to share my work with others or when I need to work together with others on the same project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I could update my local repository based on logic rather than every tiny difference. At the same time, I could make sure it's a working version.
