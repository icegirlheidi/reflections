1. When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to share my work with others or when I need to work together with others on the same project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I could update my local repository based on logic rather than every tiny difference. At the same time, I could make sure it's a working version.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When I want to copy over github, it's called forks. When I want to pull files from github to my local, then it's called clones. In my local computer, I can also clone. In my local computer, when I create different routes besides master, then it's called branches.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So after you make new commit locally, you can push your commit to github. And also if someone else commits and pushes to remote, you can pull it to your local files.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub, I may collaborate with others through online chatting and Google doc. With them, I could collaborate with others through pushing and pulling files between GitHub and my local computer. It seems using GitHub makes life easier.
