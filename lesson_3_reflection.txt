1. When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to share my work with others or when I need to work together with others on the same project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I could update my local repository based on logic rather than every tiny difference. At the same time, I could make sure it's a working version.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When I want to copy over github, it's called forks. When I want to pull files from github to my local, then it's called clones. In my local computer, I can also clone. In my local computer, when I create different routes besides master, then it's called branches.
